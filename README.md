# Cubic Spline Interpolation in Rust

This repository implements [cubic spline interpolation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cubic_Spline_Interpolation) in Rust. It relies heavily on `nalgebra` for linear algebra.

> I just started learning Rust (I haven't even finished The Book yet). This is just an exercise for myself. The program seems to work as expected, but it's probably very non-idiomatic and might have edge cases I haven't anticipated. **You probably shouldn't use it in production (or at all).**
